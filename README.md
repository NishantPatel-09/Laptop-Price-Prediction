# Laptop-Price-Prediction

This project aims to predict laptop prices using machine learning techniques. We preprocess the data, extract relevant features such as CPU brand, screen resolution, memory size, and GPU type, and apply one-hot encoding to categorical variables. After selecting the most important features based on their correlation with laptop prices, we trained and evaluated multiple models, including Random Forest Regressor and Linear Regression.

Key insights reveal that factors like CPU brand, GPU type, and memory significantly influence laptop prices. Despite challenges such as data quality issues and computational limitations, our models achieved a commendable accuracy. The project demonstrates the potential for data-driven approaches to help consumers and manufacturers make informed decisions in the competitive laptop market.

Future Directions:
Explore additional features such as build quality and battery life.
Apply ensemble learning techniques for better accuracy.
Incorporate time-series and sentiment analysis for deeper insights.
